# Predicting Metabolic Syndrome

This project aims to predict metabolic syndrome using various health and demographic variables. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that together increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Age`: Age of the individual
- `Sex`: Gender
- `Marital`: Marital status
- `Income`: Income level
- `Race`: Race
- `WaistCirc`: Waist circumference
- `BMI`: Body Mass Index
- `Albuminuria`: Presence of albumin in the urine
- `UrAlbCr`: Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio
- `UricAcid`: Uric acid level
- `BloodGlucose`: Blood glucose level
- `HDL`: HDL cholesterol level
- `Triglycerides`: Triglyceride level
- `MetabolicSyndrome`: Presence of metabolic syndrome (target variable)

## Data Analysis and Modeling

The analysis and modeling are performed using R. The process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**:

2. **Data Analysis**:

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:

## Results

The results of the analysis and modeling provide insights into which variables are significant predictors of metabolic syndrome. The visualization helps in understanding the distribution of metabolic syndrome in the population.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of predicting metabolic syndrome using a variety of health and demographic indicators. The insights gained from this analysis can help in identifying at-risk individuals and developing preventive measures.
